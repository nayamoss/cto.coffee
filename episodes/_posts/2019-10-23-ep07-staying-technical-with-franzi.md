# Episode 07
## "Staying Technical as a Manager" with Franzi

After a not-so-short [freelance-work-induced](/work-with-me) break, the podcast is back. I hope y'all had a good time
since the last episode and enjoyed lots of other interesting podcasts and of course, life.

For this episode, I had the pleasure to chat with [Franzi][@singsalad] (which took place quite a while ago ðŸ™ˆ).

We talked shortly about what Engineering Management is for us, then turned to this podcast's core question of why it
is important for engineering managers to have a deeper understanding of their team's technology. Of course we also touch
on how manager's can get or stay technical while working as a manager.

Later in the episode we also have a chance to talk about one of my favourite Engineering Management related topics,
which is the importance of re-calibrating your sense of productivity as a manager.

Enjoy!
